        <h1>Community Guidelines</h1>
        <i>Last Updated September, 17th 2023</i>
        <h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>Hey there, creative souls! âœ¨ Ready to dive into the electric currents of inspiration and connect with fellow artists? Welcome to Camphouse, where imagination knows no bounds and the vibes are always positive. To make sure everyone has a blast, we've put together these groovy Community Guidelines that lay down the law (the cool kind, of course). So, let's rock and roll!</p>

<h2>1. Embrace Positivity and Respect</h2>

<p>Let's vibe on a wavelength of positivity and respect, fam! Spread good vibes, respect diverse perspectives, and treat everyone with kindness. No room for hate speech, bullying, or any negativity that buzzkills the atmosphere.</p>

<h2>2. Keep it Clean, Folks! No NSFW/NSFL Content</h2>

<p>We're all about celebrating creativity in all its forms, but let's keep things PG-13, alright? No NSFW (Not Safe For Work) or NSFL (Not Safe For Life) content, because we're here to inspire, not shock.</p>

<h2>3. Nix the Crypto Stuff</h2>

<p>We're into all things artistic and innovative, but we're not boarding the crypto train here. No cryptocurrencies or NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens) on Camphouse, folks. This platform is for sharing your creative masterpieces, not for trading digital currencies.</p>

<h2>4. Share Your Original Grooves</h2>

<p>Showcase your original content and let your creativity run wild. It's all about sharing what makes your heart sing, so respect copyright and intellectual property rights. Only post what's rightfully yours or you have permission to use.</p>

<h2>5. Mind Your Ps and Qs</h2>

<p>While we're all for expressing your thoughts, let's keep the conversation clean and friendly. No hate speech, no spam, and definitely no promoting harmful stuff. Keep the community lively and focused on the art!</p>

<h2>6. Report and Reach Out</h2>

<p>If you spot anything that's not jiving with our guidelines or raises an eyebrow, hit us up! Use the reporting tools and let us know. We're here to keep the vibes positive, so your feedback is key.</p>

<h2>7. The Power of Unity</h2>

<p>Remember, Camphouse is a creative haven where we come together to lift each other up. Connect, collaborate, and create some magic. Let's grow and thrive as a creative collective!</p>

<h2>8. Be Mindful of Our Earth</h2>

<p>If you're into sharing physical creations, let's be mindful of Mother Earth. Use eco-friendly materials, and let's leave a lighter footprint on this beautiful planet we call home.<p>

<h2>9. Keep Exploring!</h2>

<p>We're all about the exploration of new horizons, genres, and styles. Keep evolving and experimenting, and inspire others to do the same. We're in this journey together, and the sky's the limit!</p>

<h2>10. Keep it spam-free</h2>
<p> We all know how Spam is salty, don't lie! But here at Camphouse, we want our communities to be spam free, both salty and the overkill text, this means no</p>
<p> - Long text in post titles, descriptions, usernames, handles, bios, ect, ect.</p>

<h2>Our Tunes Can Change</h2>

<p>Just like a melody evolves, so can our guidelines. We might groove to a different tune as time goes on, and if that happens, we'll keep you in the loop. Your creativity drives the beat, after all!</p>

<p>So there you have it, fellow creators! Let's make Camphouse a place where innovation, connection, and positivity collide. Together, we'll create a masterpiece of a community. Now, let's get out there and paint the town with our creative vibes! ðŸŒˆðŸŽ¨</p>
